    <p>Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the
        activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly
        carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded
        them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,
        was nothing to what at last met our eyes.</p>
    <p>It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring
        him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled
        cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we afterwards
        learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along with
        him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the
        revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever
        he went.</p>
