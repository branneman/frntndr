            <h1>The Grunt buildscript explained</h1>
            <p>First, make sure you have a basic understanding of what Grunt does, go read the Grunt
                <a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guide.</p>

            <h2>The default task</h2>
            <p>The build task, does several things in the following order: Sass compilation, autoprefixer,
                copying all the files into the <code>build/</code> directory, minifying images, removing the
                Swig includes (replacing them with the actual html) and minifying javascript with UglifyJS.</p>

            <h2>The watcher task</h2>
            <p>This <b>internal</b> task is automatically active when the node server is started, and remains
                active. Output or errors from Sass or Autoprefixer are printed to the command line.</p>
            <p>This task is not intended to be started manually!</p>

            <h2>The test task</h2>
            <p>This task runs both JSHint and Jasmine, in that order. You can find the configuration
                for JSHint in the file <code>.jshintrc</code> The Jasmine specs are located in
                <code>/src/static/js/spec/</code></p>

            <h2>The zip task</h2>
            <p>This task zip's the entire <code>build/</code> directory. The default build has
                to be ran first.</p>

            <h2>The deploy task</h2>
            <p>This task uploads the entire content of the <code>build/</code> directory to the ftp server.
                Hence, it can't upload anything if you didn't run the build first.</p>
            <p>For it to work, you need to enter your credentials in the <code>.ftppass</code>
                file, and your ftp server info in the <code>config.json</code> file.</p>
